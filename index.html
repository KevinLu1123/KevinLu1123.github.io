Hello! My name is Kevin Lu, a junior at the University of Pennsylvania studying cognitive science.
My interests are fairly broad, as I enjoy reading news about developments in life sciences and pharmaceuticals, as well as some finance news and especially anything related to data analytics and artificial intelligence, the latter of which might be obvious given the nature of my coursework which focuses on linguistics, psychology, and computer science. Although this covers some of my academic interests, I’d claim that I’m a more interesting person than just that, so this website can tell you just a little more than what that pdf that brought you here might indicate.
By training I consider myself a data analyst, although I have had experiences consulting as a project lead and working in a credit union as a Chief Information Officer. I spent time my freshman year working on a project for startup ideas revolving around medical devices and HIV prevalence in Philly. I led a team in makerthons and pitch competitions, and although we didn’t win it was the first time I was exposed to the business side of things, having up till now been only involved in engineering ideation. From here I’d go on to become corporate sponsorship chair in a club and then continuing those tasks over in a startup organization. The next semester, I joined the Student Federal Credit Union at the University of Pennsylvania, where I specifically joined the Information Systems committee. There, I improved my coding skills while learning more about financial institutions and working on projects related to security as well as website redesign. At the SFCU, I even became the VP of Information Systems, also known as the Chief Information Officer sitting on the Executive Board. In this capacity I was responsible for facilitating communication between the Executive Board and my own committee as well as sorting out any technical difficulties that arose throughout the day. Some of the job was triage, but other times it would be planning for the future and delegating tasks and schedules. One of the biggest events of my term was of course covid, which resulted in us switching to remote access. We managed to quickly get a VPN server up and running so that we could work on customer analytics projects with sensitive user data, a topic I had put a moratorium on due to data security concerns. In the remaining time before the expiration of my term, I worked on creating a proper IT audit guide for the Supervisory department to train with. At the same time I held this VP position, I was also exploring consulting through the Wharton Asia Exchange Global Strategy committee, in which I served as a project lead working on a project to create a survey for a nonprofit organization to use to help reduce gun violence in Philly.
Next up, my hobbies! I still consider myself a chess player and swimmer, despite my competitive run ending pretty much before college. I still play online whenever I have free time, and swim a bit to keep in shape. Other hobbies I’ve picked up are billiards, mahjong, and poker - but any card game will do as I’m always down to learn new games. Most of my reading was done in middle school and some in high school, although I’m trying get back into literature these days. When I was younger, I would read Tolkien’s classic works as well as Homer’s Iliad multiple times over. Overall I’ve read quite a few classics, some notable (notable = I enjoyed + I can remember off the top of my head) ones being One Hundred Years of Solitude, Of Mice and Men, Corelli’s Mandolin, We the Living, and A Farewell to Arms. Most recently, I’ve been trying to delve into Asian literature, with some historical readings on ancient China and modern Japanese writer Osamu Dazai’s No Longer Human.
This website is meant to showcase some of the work I’ve done over the past few years to expand on what’s on my resume as well as things perhaps not listed.
I have of course some projects I’ve worked on, as well as some papers I’ve written, whether they be statistics, business, or literature papers. I think this varied spread will showcase my writing most faithfully.
